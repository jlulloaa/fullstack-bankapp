# Description
*The reasons why this project exists, including the answers to pertinent questions such as whom does it help, why did you build it, and what business or personal problem does it solve*

This is the final project I am doing as part of the [full-stack web developer certificate](https://executive-ed.xpro.mit.edu/professional-certificate-coding) I am pursuing. Unlike the previous excercises, this is a real-life working full stack application, with the front end a refactoring of the original [BadBank app](http://jose-ulloabankingapplication.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/) developed by myself as part of the 2nd project of this course. The back end is a work in progress and will be made up of a MongoDB to store the data and Node.js server (*Details to come as I progress with the work*)

# Additional Information
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
